                At Cupertino Robotics, Team 2473 Goldstrikers operates with the guidance of FRC mentors. 
                Students learn the principles of engineering, mechanical design, computer vision, and software. FRC does not focus solely on the technical aspect of robotics. 
                PR, Business, and Outreach are also key parts of Team 2473 Goldstrikers. Students organize and volunteer at various outreach events, 
                where they spread the values of FIRST and inspire more kids to pursue careers in STEM. 
                <br> <br>
                Team 2473 Goldstrikers meets four times per week for 2 hours at a time in the roboshack.
